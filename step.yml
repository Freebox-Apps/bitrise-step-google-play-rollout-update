  Google Play Rollout Update
summary: |
  This step connects to Google Play and check if there is a release in production with an in progress rollout. If found, it increases it to the next rollout percentage [2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 50%, 100%]
description: |
  The step makes use of the python library and Edits Api from Google Play. It downloads the info from the production track, and looks if any release in there has a 'userFraction' property defined. In case it has, and it is between 0 and 1, then it just modifies it to the next step, or completes the release if next is 100%

# If this step should be available only for certain project types
# just uncomment this `project_type_tags` section and include all the
# project types supported by the step. If the step can be used for all
# project types then you can just remove this section.
# If no `project_type_tags` specified (or specified as an empty array)
# that means the step can be used for any project type.
